    <h2>NAME: MICHAEL UCHECHUKWU EGE</h2>
    <h3>NICKNAME: MICKIE</h3>
    <p>Hello esteemed and beloved course mates, I am Michael Uchechukwu Ege, a Nigerian who resides in Ogun State, Nigeria with my state of origin to be Abia State making me an Igbo boy by tribe.
         <p></p>
         I am presently studying WEB & COMPUTER PROGRAMMIMG in BYU-Idaho University online. I love reading, jumping and footracing. I am still single and I am intensely learning reasonable skills geared towards helping me attain success and reliable sources of income in the nearest future.
         I love BYU-Idaho for the detailed explanation entailed in all the courses they offer and as an online student, this exceptional standard of theirs has really helped me learn a great deal so far and gives me the confidence to prove my ability to show what I have learnt without fear of failing.
         The fact that the Devotionals are added to the course is another good thing to be happy about because they act as the source of motivation and encouragement that guides one to keep going irrespective of any potential or threatening obstacle(s).
         Since when I was a kid, I have loved technology. This helped to develop the interest of learning a branch of technology and to take it as a career where I will become among those making great transformation in the technological aspect of life (the financial gains is not an exemption of my interest in technology :)).
         <p></p>
        GOD BLESS US ALL ESPECIALLY WHEN WE EXHIBIT OUR FAITH AND HARDWORK! AMEN.</p>
